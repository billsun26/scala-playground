scala-playground
================
This project contains some Tutorials and exercises for developers ramping up on Scala/functional programming and the Play framework. The exercises cover some core aspects of day-to-day Scala programming, including the following concepts:

- `Future`
- `Option`
- `Either/Left/Right`
- `Some`
- `None`
- `match/case`
- `map/flatMap`

### Setup
1. Download latest play framework binaries from https://www.playframework.com/download. Move the play executable binaries somewhere easily accessible, such as /usr/bin.
2. Add the activator executable to your env path.
3. Navigate to scala-playground/src, type `activator`. This is the keyword to enter the play framework console (from versions 2.3 onwards, the `play` keyword has been deprecated). For more details, see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/PlayConsole.
4. For IntelliJ IDE setup, type `idea` inside the activator console to generate the necessary project files. Use IntelliJ's "Open Project" feature to open the project by selecting the generated .idea file.
5. The tutorial files are located at [scala-playground/src/app/models/Playground.scala](https://github.com/billsun26/scala-playground/blob/master/src/app/models/Playground.scala)
6. Enjoy!
